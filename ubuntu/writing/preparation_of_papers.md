# Preparation of papers for IEEE transactions and journals

## 标题
-  Paper titles should be written in uppercase and lowercase letters, not all uppercase.
-  Avoid writing long formulas with subscripts in the title; short formulas that identify the elements are fine (e.g., "Nd–Fe–B"). 
-  Do not write “(Invited)” in the title.
-  Full names of authors are preferred in the author field, but are not required. Put a space between authors’ initials. 


## 摘要
- the abstract must be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of the full article. 
- The abstract must be between **150–250 words**. 
- The abstract must be written as one paragraph, and should not contain displayed mathematical equations or tabular material. 
- The abstract should include three or four different keywords or phrases, as this will help readers to find it. 
- It is important to avoid over-repetition of such phrases as this can result in a page being rejected by search engines.
